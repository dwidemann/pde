# These are some some scripts to investigate using compute graphs for physics simulations. 

Each script can be run looking at the header in its file. 

## To Do

 1. Add a req file
 2. Add a notebook that demos each script
 3. Surrogate modeling
 4. Gym environment with wave equation, learn policy for it.
